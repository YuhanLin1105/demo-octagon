## development experience

using app.js control the page rendering. 

future thought:
    if the Project is becoming more and more complex, we could use React-Router to rending component with different url and use Redux to control the globle state.



By using SVG sprite, we can use 1 HTTP request for all svgs.( This is good for HTTP/1.1 not HTTP/2 protocol). and style all svgs.
